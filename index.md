# Abstract
---
A calibration procedure that does not need additional external sensors or tools, i.e., self-contained, and can be performed entirely automatically, is a significant advantage, especially for complex robotic systems. Here we show that the kinematics of a multi-fingered robotic hand can be precisely calibrated only by moving the tips of the fingers pairwise into contact. The only prerequisite for this is sensitive contact detection, e.g., by torque-sensing in the joints (as in our DLR-Hand II) or tactile skin. The measurement function for a given joint angle configuration is the distance between the modeled fingertip geometries, but the actual measurement is always zero. In an in-depth analysis, we prove that this contact-based calibration determines all quantities needed for manipulating objects with the hand, i.e., the difference vectors of the fingertips, and that it is as complete as a calibration using an external visual tracking system and markers. We describe the complete calibration scheme, including selecting optimal sample joint configurations and search motions for the contacts despite the initial kinematic uncertainties. In a real-world calibration experiment for the torque-controlled four-finger DLR-Hand II, the maximal error of 17.7mm could be reduced to only 3.7mm.
